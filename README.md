# Airfare Dataset Description

Machine Learning for Airfare Prediction

This dataset is useful for evaluating or developing new prediction models of airfare prices.

The dataset contains 1814 flights. This data originally used in a 10-fold crossvalidation procedure to train and evaluate several state of the art machine learning models applied to predict the airfare prices.

Records are for flights from Thessaloniki (SKG) - Greece --> Stuttgart (STR) - Germany

This dataset was manually collected from [Airtickets.gr](http://www.airtickets.gr)

For every flight the following features were considered:

 F1: Feature 1 - departure time.

 F2: Feature 2 - arrival time.

 F3: Feature 3 - number of free luggage (0, 1 or 2).

 F4: Feature 4 - days left until departure.

 F5: Feature 5 - number of intermediate stops.

 F6: Feature 6 - holiday day (yes or no).

 F7: Feature 7 - overnight flight (yes or no).

 F8: Feature 8 - day of week.
