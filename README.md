Machine Learning for Airfare Prediction

In this project we compared 8 state of art models for predicting airfares

The dataset contains 1814 flights for training, and 100 flights for testing.

Records are for flights from Thessaloniki (SKG) --> Stuttgart (STR)

This dataset was manually collected from [Airtickets.gr](http://www.airtickets.gr)

For every flight the following features were considered:

 F1: Feature 1 - departure time.

 F2: Feature 2 - arrival time.

 F3: Feature 3 - number of free luggage (0, 1 or 2).

 F4: Feature 4 - days left until departure.

 F5: Feature 5 - number of intermediate stops.

 F6: Feature 6 - holiday day (yes or no).

 F7: Feature 7 - overnight flight (yes or no).

 F8: Feature 8 - day of week.
